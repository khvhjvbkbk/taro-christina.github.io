              A Tarot card spread is a method of fortune telling that predicts the future or analyzes the current situation based on
              the symbols and images on the Tarot cards. Each card has its own symbolic meaning and can be interpreted either alone or
              in combination with other cards. A Tarot card reading can help you gain insight and advice on various issues or
              problems.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text lead text-muted-light lh-1 fst-italic">
            Tarot cards are a deck of 78 cards, each of which has its own unique image and meaning. The deck is divided into two
            parts: major and minor arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, and the Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards, divided
            into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles. Each card in the Tarot deck represents a different aspect of life
            and has a unique meaning. Some cards represent emotions, others actions or events. Tarot cards are used to gain insight
            into a situation or to understand an issue or problem.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text lead text-muted-light lh-1 fst-italic">
            The technique of fortune telling is based on the idea that a randomly chosen card or several Tarot cards somehow
            contain a symbolic answer to the question that the fortuneteller asked, verbally or mentally, before selecting these
            cards from
            decks. Many tarot readers agree that the practice of fortune telling obviously cannot provide answers to specific
            questions or
            provide the fortuneteller with accurate information (account or telephone number, amount of money, number of items,
            etc.), equals
            as well as answering a question that requires a clear answer “yes” or “no”. However, Tarot fortune telling is supposedly
            is credited with the ability to predict the course of events, explain the hidden causes of events and the motives of
            people’s actions,
            predict in general terms the results of applying efforts in one direction or another. Tarot readers also warn against
            attempts to repeat fortune-telling on the same topic within a relatively short period of time, counting such
            repeated fortune telling is unreliable.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text lead text-muted-light lh-1 fst-italic">
            If you receive a tarot reading from a professional, you can expect to have a conversation with them about your question
            or situation.
            The fortuneteller may ask you to shuffle the deck or do it yourself. After the cards have been drawn,
            the fortuneteller will interpret them and give you advice and recommendations based on the meanings of the cards. Tarot
            fortune telling
            is meant to predict the future, but rather to give you guidance and insight.

            Calculation of a natal chart is an astrological procedure in which an astrologer analyzes the positions of the planets
            at the time of a person’s birth and constructs a chart
            vault of heaven, reflecting these positions. The natal chart provides information about character, potentials, destiny
            and
            a person’s life path, and also allows one to predict the influence of planets on various aspects of his life.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text lead text-muted-light lh-1 fst-italic">
            A natal chart (also called a cosmogram or personal birth horoscope) is a kind of diagram compiled with
            taking into account the position of celestial bodies at the time of your birth. We all take a screenshot on our phone if
            we need to capture
            something important - similarly, if we fix the position of the planets at the moment of a person’s birth, such a sky map
            can
            tell a lot about his life and fate. In this case, knowledge of astrology serves as a navigator on the natal chart, which
            will help you achieve your goals by avoiding difficult situations. Knowing your natal chart will help you see your
            professional purpose, your talents, possible difficulties in life and effective ways to overcome them

            To build a natal chart, it is enough to know the exact date and place of birth of a person. It is also advisable to know
            at least
            the approximate time of day you were born. There are many ways to calculate a natal chart (for example, Vedic,
            meridian, equidominous, Placidus house calculation system) - there is no universal answer to the question of which one
            to choose,
            exists. If you are interested, you can try to build your natal chart using different calculation systems and
            see how much the result differs.
